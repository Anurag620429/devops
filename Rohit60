To begin working with Git, the first step is to create a GitHub account using a valid email address. Once the account is set up, a new repository should be created, for example named “abc,” with its visibility set to public and without adding a README file at the start, keeping all other settings as default. After that, Git Bash needs to be installed on the local computer. Then, a new folder can be created on the system, such as “abc,” and by right-clicking inside the folder, the option “Open Git Bash here” should be selected. A command-line interface window will open where the user must configure their Git credentials to connect Git Bash with GitHub by entering the following commands: git config --global user.email "user’s email id" and git config --global user.name "user’s name". Once this setup is done, the repository link (URL) from GitHub must be copied, and the command git clone <repository-url> should be executed to clone the repository onto the local machine. After cloning, the command ls can be used to check the contents of the folder, and by typing cd abc, the user can move into the project directory. To check the status of files in the repository, git status is used, which shows which files are tracked or untracked. After making changes in the folder, git status can again be used to review the modifications. To stage all the files for commit, the command git add . is used, while to add only a specific file, git add <filename> is applied. After staging, the user commits the changes with git commit -m "User’s message", which finalizes the modifications before pushing them. Finally, the command git push is executed to upload the committed changes to the GitHub repository. Other useful commands include git checkout -b <branch-name>, which creates and switches to a new branch, and git pull, which is used to fetch and merge updates from the remote repository.

To create an EC2 instance, one must log in to the AWS Management Console, search for EC2 in the search bar, and click the first EC2 option that appears. Then, the “Launch Instance” button should be selected, followed by giving the instance a name and choosing the preferred operating system such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or Windows. The next step involves selecting the volume type and instance type, then either creating a new key pair or using an existing one. A key pair acts as a secure login credential for accessing the instance. While creating a key pair, a name must be given, the key type should remain RSA by default, and the format can be selected as either .pem or .ppk depending on the operating system. After creating the key pair, the file will be automatically downloaded, and the rest of the instance settings can be left as default.

For configuring GitHub Actions, open the GitHub repository and navigate to the “Settings” section. From the left sidebar, choose “Actions,” then go to “Secrets and Variables,” where new secrets can be created. A secret consists of a name and a value. For example, the secret name can be EC2_HOST, and the value should contain the EC2 public IPv4 address, EC2 user, and SSH key. This setup allows GitHub Actions to securely connect and deploy to the EC2 instance. After pushing any new modifications from Git Bash, the GitHub repository can be opened, and under the “Actions” tab, the deployment process can be viewed. Once the workflow runs successfully, it confirms that the CI/CD pipeline has been configured and executed properly, completing the automated deployment of the updated code.
